## Practice
1. Test out the arithmetic capabilities of R; experiment by doing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Go back to your "RMarkdown Practice" file and experiment with titles, text, and syntax.
3. Copy and paste the following two pieces of code into the document (include the gray code "chunks").

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library("tidyverse")
```

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar()
```

4. Now `knit` the file to html using the knit button at the top of the page.
5. Lastly, commit and push this file to your GitHub repository.
